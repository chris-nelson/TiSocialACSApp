This is a skeleton social app using SDK 3.0 and Appcelerator Cloud Services on the Back End.

**Includes:**
I have only included moment.js for date manipulation and am using glyphics icons and TWG Retina Icons for Tabs and navButtons. (http://glyphicons.com and http://blog.twg.ca/2010/11/retina-display-icon-set/)

**Install Instructions:**
- Clone App
- Create new ACS App
- Replace oAuth credentials in tiapp.xml

Resources/config/config.js is included globablly in app.js - Currently only primaryColor, secondaryColor, primaryFont and secondaryFont are implemented but many more will follow.


This is my fist open source project so be easy on me. I am still not familiar enough with Alloy to have done this project using it, but once finished I'd love to see some forks of it utilizing alloy.I plan to update the issue tracker with all of the planned enhancements/features. if you would like to contribute to any of them feel free to submit a pull request.

I also plan to make a WebApp with AngularJS and Bootstrap one this is in a finished enough state.
